    hash1: 'A gas-tight, pressure-resistant container with a valve and propellant.  When the valve is opened, propellant forces the product from the container in a fine or coarse spray pattern or stream.  (e.g., a spray can dispensing paint, furniture polish, etc, under pressure).  It does not include atomizers, because atomizers do not rely on a pressurised container to propel product from the container. '
    hash2: "A relatively small container made from glass or plastic tubing, the end of which is drawn into a stem and closed by fusion after filling.  The bottom may be flat, convex, or drawn out.  An ampoule is opened by breaking the stem. "
    hash3: "A device for reducing a liquid to a fine spray. (i.e. medicine, perfume, etc).  An atomizer does not rely on a pressurised container for the propellant.  Usually air is provided by squeezing a rubber bulb attached to the atomizer. "
    hash4: "A preformed, flexible container, generally enclosed on all but one side, which forms an opening that may or may not be sealed after filling. "
    hash5: "Bag-In-Box or BIB is a type of container for the storage and transportation of liquids. It consists of a strong bladder, usually made of aluminium PET film or other plastics seated inside a corrugated fibreboard box. The box and internal bag can be fused together. In most cases there is nozzle or valve fixed to the bag. The nozzle can be connected easily to a dispensing installation or the valve allows for convenient dispensing. "

    hash9: "A type of packaging in which the item is secured between a preformed (usually transparent plastic) dome or “bubble” and a paperboard surface or “carrier.” Attachment may be by stapling, heat-sealing, gluing, or other means.

Blisters are most usually thermoformed from polyvinyl chloride; however, almost any thermoplastic can be thermoformed into a blister."
    hash10: "A container having a round neck of relatively smaller diameter than the body and an opening capable of holding a closure for retention of the contents. Specifically, a narrow-necked container as compared with a jar or wide-mouth container.  The cross section of the bottle may be round, oval, square, oblong, or a combination of these.  Bottles generally are made of glass or plastics, but can also be earthenware or metal. Bottle may be disposable, recyclable, returnable, or reusable. "
    hash11: "A non-specific term used to refer to a rigid, three-dimensional container with closed faces that completely enclose its contents and may be made out of any material.

    hash19: "A non-specific term usually referring to a rigid three-dimensional container with semi-closed faces that enclose its contents for shipment or storage. Crates could have an open or closed top and may have internal divers. Even though some crates might be reused or become resealed they could also be disposable depending on the product hierarchy. "
    hash20: "A small bowl shaped container for beverages, often with a handle.  "

    hash23: "A predominantly flat container of flexible material having only two faces, and joined at three edges to form an enclosure.  The non-joined edge provides a filling opening, which may later be closed by a gummed or adhesive flap, heat seal, tie string, metal clasp, or other methods.  "
